This is my personal means of sorting my pictures and videos. The main impetus is that each
individual file will land in a directory denoting the day it was captured. Right now this
has support for exif information as well as parsing out meta information from MTS files to
get the date of capture. If neither works the file timestamp is used as a fallback.

To use it just run the multi_orgainze.sh script. Running it with no args will print out the
usage information and an example.
